# POWER-WASH

Made to flow like a single page app. The user is presented with NavTabs that sned the user to different corresponding pages based uponm the click. The user will read the prices of the site, and make an appointment. The data collected goes to firebase to be stored adn is returned to the user in a model as a receipt. If the form is not full filled a modal will telll the user that all feilds are required. The receipt modal returns the users inputted information and a google maps window of the users inputed address information. 

Future functionality would build the site to accept reviews, and have an email confirmation service and date/time scheduler for the appointments.
